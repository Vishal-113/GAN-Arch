        "\n",
        "False Negative Rate (FNR) Parity measures whether the rate of false negatives is consistent across different groups within the dataset (e.g., gender, race, age). A false negative occurs when a model incorrectly predicts a negative outcome for a positive case (e.g., rejecting a loan application for a creditworthy applicant).\n",

        "1. **Fairness**: Ensures that certain groups are not disproportionately impacted by being denied benefits or opportunities.\n",
        "2. **Equity**: Helps identify and mitigate systemic biases that might disadvantage marginalized groups.\n",
